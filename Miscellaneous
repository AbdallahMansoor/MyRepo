- use 'code.exe' from the WSL terminal instead of just 'code' to open vscode without initializing the wsl extension. (related resource: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/43237)

- the 'which' command: use it in the terminal to know the source of a binary or exe (e.g which ssh, which flutter)

- Keep it local, cache, frontend data organization, storing, retrieval,hint: store image/file url(any type of url) in the database, for faster loading 

- using http headers as extra layer for reinforcing authenticity

- to connect to WSL 2 from your LAN (e.g. mobile browser): (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking), you can the view internal IP of the WSL using the command 'ip addr'
- use WSL 1 for better performance and networking simplicity

- Chrome flag: "Insecure origins treated as secure", to treat certain origins as secure ones even though they are not (e.g. http://localhost). (https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/)
