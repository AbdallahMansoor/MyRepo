- use 'code.exe' from the WSL terminal instead of just 'code' to open vscode without initializing the wsl extension, I don't know why

- the 'which' command: use it in the terminal to know the source of a binary or exe (e.g which ssh, which flutter)

- Keep it local, cache, frontend data organization, storing, retrieval,hint: store image/file url(any type of url) in the database, for faster loading 

- using http headers as extra layer for reinforcing authenticity

- dispatch/fake an event on an element  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent 

- clearTimeout(timeoutID), clearInterval(intervalID) methods cancels a timeout,interval previously established by calling setTimeout(), setInterval().
