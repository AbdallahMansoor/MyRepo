-use 'code.exe' from the WSL terminal instead of just 'code' to open vscode without initializing the wsl extension, I don't know why

-the 'which' command: use it in the terminal to know the source of a binary or exe (e.g which ssh, which flutter)

-Keep it local, cache, frontend data organization, storing, retrieval,hint: store image/file url(any type of url) in the database, for faster loading
