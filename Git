- A branch is a movable pointer(movable tag), it moves to the new commit as long as you were checked-out on this branch

- Revert (it makes a new commit that undoes the specified commit): so you don't lose any data, also as a way to store experimental ideas (make a certain commit, and then revert it) without the need to create a whole branch for it.

- using git cherry-pick to cherry-pick certain commits into another location in the tree

- git 'fetch/push' should be followed by 'refspec' to specify the mapping of references fetched/pushed between the local and the remote repos. if the 'dist' is omitted it means to update the same refs as the 'src' (i.e. git push origin main). (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)
- Hence, if you want to push all branches and all tags, you can run "git push origin 'refs/heads*' 'refs/tags*'". 
- for fetch, "git fetch -u origin 'refs/heads*:refs/heads*' 'refs/tags*:refs/tags*'", when using fetch, I have to put -u flag for internal git issue, and in fetch you can't omit dist.

- Connect to a remote repository for pushing or fetching/pulling : "git remote add origin {URL}"

- Search for a string across all branches: git grep "string/regexp" $(git rev-list --all)
