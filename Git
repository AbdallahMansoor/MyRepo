- A branch is a movable pointer(movable tag), it moves to the new commit as long as you were checked-out on this branch

- Revert (it makes a new commit that undoes the specified commit): so you don't lose any data, also as a way to store experimental ideas (make a certain commit, and then revert it) without the need to create a whole branch for it.

- using git cherry-pick to cherry-pick certain commits into another location in the tree

- git 'fetch/push' should be followed by a reference (refspec, src:dist), if the 'dist' is omitted it means to update the same ref as the 'src'. (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)
