- A branch is a movable pointer(movable tag), it moves to the new commit as long as you were checked-out on this branch

- Revert (it makes a new commit that undoes the specified commit): so you don't lose any data, also as a way to store experimental ideas (in a certain commit, and then revert) without the need to create a whole branch for it.
